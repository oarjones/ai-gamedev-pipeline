feat: Add GameObject details and project file scanning

This commit expands the environment awareness capabilities of the AI by adding functionality to inspect individual GameObjects and list project files.

Key changes include:
- **`unity_project/Assets/Editor/MCP/EnvironmentScanner.cs`:**
  - Implemented `GetGameObjectDetailsAsJson(int instanceId)` to retrieve detailed information about a GameObject, including its name, instance ID, active status, tag, layer, transform properties, and a selection of public properties from its components using reflection.
  - Implemented `GetProjectFilesAsJson(string path)` to list subdirectories and files within a specified relative path under the Assets folder, with security checks to prevent directory traversal.
- **`unity_project/Assets/Editor/MCP/CommandDispatcher.cs`:**
  - Modified the `DispatchMessage` method to recognize and handle new query actions:
    - `get_gameobject_details`: Calls `EnvironmentScanner.GetGameObjectDetailsAsJson()` with the provided `instanceId`.
    - `get_project_files`: Calls `EnvironmentScanner.GetProjectFilesAsJson()` with the provided `path`.
  - Ensures proper parameter extraction and error handling for these new queries.
