# Cleanup Audit (initial)

Items:
- scripts/archive/start_dashboard_old.bat â†’ MOVE (replaced by dev_up/dev_down and Process Manager)

Notes:
- This is an initial, conservative audit. Most items default to KEEP until automated tools (depcheck/ts-prune/vulture) are run locally and results reviewed.
- Final decisions should be validated with tools/cleanup/verify_cleanup.py and the dashboard health/self-test.
- start_agp_debug.bat ? MOVE (replaced by dev_up and Process Manager)
- start_agp_system.bat ? MOVE (replaced by dev_up and /system APIs)
- stop_agp_system.bat ? MOVE (replaced by dev_down and /system/stop)
